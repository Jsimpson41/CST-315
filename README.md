# CST315 Project - UNIX/Linux Exploration

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Joshua Simpson a student pursuing Computer Science at Grand Canyon university. This project is part of CST 315, where I explore various features of the UNIX/Linux operating system. As I dive into different aspects of the operating system, I aim to understand the underlying mechanisms and enhance my proficiency in working with UNIX/Linux environments.

## Features Explored

### 1. File Navigation (ls Command)
   - **Explanation:** Accessing the list of files in a folder using the `ls` command.
   - **Behind the Scenes:** The `ls` command interacts with the file system to fetch and display directory content.

### 2. Process Information (ps Command)
   - **Explanation:** Displaying information about active processes using the `ps` command.
   - **Behind the Scenes:** The `ps` command retrieves details from the operating system kernel about running processes.

### 3. Package Management (apt Command)
   - **Explanation:** Searching for and installing software packages using the `apt` command.
   - **Behind the Scenes:** The `apt` command connects to repositories, fetches package information, and handles installations.

### 4. Text Art with Figlet
   - **Explanation:** Creating text art with figlet to generate ASCII representations of text.
   - **Behind the Scenes:** Figlet applies fonts to transform text into visually appealing ASCII art.

### 5. System Update (apt-get Update)
   - **Explanation:** Updating the package list using `apt-get update`.
   - **Behind the Scenes:** The `apt-get` command communicates with repositories to ensure the local package list is current.

## About Me
